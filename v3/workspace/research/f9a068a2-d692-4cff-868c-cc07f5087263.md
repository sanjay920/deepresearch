## Result
### Answer
Google's stock (GOOG) closed at **172.22** on February 27, 2025. 

Please note that the question asks for the closing price on February 28, 2025, but the available data from the webpage is for February 27, 2025. 

The data is found in the "Trailing total returns" table, which provides a comparison of GOOG's performance with the S&P 500 index. The table header specifies "Trailing total returns as of 2/28/2025," but the data below it clearly states "As of 2/27/2025." This discrepancy suggests a possible error on the webpage.

Here's the relevant section from the webpage:
